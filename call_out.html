    	Apparently you figure that this all is a dream and proceed to call out to<br />
        see if anything responds in the room. Quietly you utter, “Is anybody there?”<br />
        Almost instantaneously, your voice reverberates back at such a large volume<br />
        that you cover your ears from the pain. A red light emits in the room revealing<br />
        that you are in a very small empty room with blank walls. The red light starts to<br />
        gradually flash on and off. Before you have a chance to know what’s going on, the<br />			 		floor disappears beneath you and you fall into the abyss.
