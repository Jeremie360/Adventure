    	You notice that Room R seems to have a golden knob on the door. Around the<br />
        knob is a short Elven inscription, surprisingly which you can read, that states<br />
        “DO NOT TOUCH” in big letters. Sitting there for what seemed to be a couple moments<br />
        you deliberated at what to do and end up deciding to proceed through the door<br />
        anyway. Right as your hand begins to vigilantly turn the knob, you get a sense that<br />
        this door was probably not the best pick. The knob, already supercharged with<br />
        999.667 milliamperes of voltages, destructively electrocutes your entire body<br />
        freezing your heart and killing you instantly.
