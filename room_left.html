    	Gradually you approach Room L, your heart pounding loudly from fear that<br />
        you feel the pulses in your head. As you approach the door within 2 feet of<br />
        distance, the door to Room L automatically dissolves. You stand a little puzzled,<br />				 		but before you can make out what happened a gravitational force pulls you in and the<br />
        door reappears behind you trapping you inside. After a few seconds of darkness,<br />
        thousands of red laser lines activate and begin to slowly pierce through your skull.<br />
        You try to scream in pain, but even you can’t hear yourself. Slowly, you die from<br />
        toxic brain poisoning.
